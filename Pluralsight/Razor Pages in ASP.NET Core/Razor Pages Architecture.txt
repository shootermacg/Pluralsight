*) Razor Pages use an MVVM approach

1) One File Approach
info) you can have both your markup and your code in a single file

2) Two file approach
info) you need the following directives:

@page - delcares the file as a razor page to .net core
@model IndexModel - tells .net core what the page model is for this template

3) The Model class inherits from the PageModel class.
The model class comes with an OnGet method for when this page is requested.
This is usually a good place to initialize data etc


Declaring properties in the code-behind will make them visibile to the markup through the model.

@foreach (var item in Model.Menu)
{
	<p>@item.Name</p>
}
