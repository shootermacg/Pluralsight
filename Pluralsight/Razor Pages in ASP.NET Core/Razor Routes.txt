Razor Routes
----------------
1) Changing the perceived Page Link:
--------------------------------------------
- Just say I want to add a custom route to a page called Feedback.
- I would add the route next to the @page directive
@page "/thoughts"
- The page link doesn't need to change@
<a class="nav-link" asp-page="Feedback">Feedback</a>

- But if I click on the link the url will be: 
- localhost/thoughts instead of localhost/feedback
