Where would you use this Tag Helper?
- Just say you wanted to use the full bootstrap files for dev but the minified files for production.
1) Add the markup:

<environment include="Development">
    <script src="~/js/jquery.js"></script>
    <script src="~/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
</environment>
<environment include="Production">
    <script src="~/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="~/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</environment>

2) To Test Open launchSettings.json in the Properties folder and change:
"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development" to "Production" for both IIS and Kestral profiles
